## I. Rules of Usage

### Rule 1. Possessive singular: add 's

Charles's friend; Burns's poems. Exceptions: ancient names (*the heel of Achilles*), *Jesus'*, *for conscience' sake*. Pronouns *hers, its, theirs, yours* have no apostrophe.

### Rule 2. Serial comma

Use a comma after each term except the last: *red, white, and blue*.

### Rule 3. Parenthetic expressions: enclose in commas

*The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.* Never insert one comma and omit the other. Non-restrictive clauses (*which*) get commas; restrictive clauses (*who/that*) do not.

### Rule 4. Comma before co-ordinate conjunction

*The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape.* If an adverb (*therefore, accordingly*) introduces the second clause, use a semicolon instead.

### Rule 5. Do not join independent clauses by a comma

Use a semicolon: *It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark.* Exception: very short, parallel clauses (*Man proposes, God disposes*).

### Rule 6. Do not break sentences in two

Do not use periods for commas. Wrong: *I met them on a liner. Coming home from Liverpool.* Emphatic fragments are acceptable only when the emphasis is warranted.

### Rule 7. Opening participial phrase must refer to the grammatical subject

| Wrong | Right |
|---|---|
| On arriving in Chicago, his friends met him. | On his arrival in Chicago, his friends met him. |
| Being in a dilapidated condition, I bought the house cheap. | (Recast to avoid absurdity.) |

## II. Principles of Composition

### Rule 8. One paragraph, one topic

Each paragraph signals a new step. Subdivide when it aids the reader. Avoid single-sentence paragraphs except for transitions.

### Rule 9. Topic sentence first, close in conformity

(a) Topic sentence at or near the beginning; (b) body develops it; (c) final sentence reinforces or draws a consequence. Avoid ending with a digression.

### Rule 10. Use the active voice

| Passive (weak) | Active (strong) |
|---|---|
| My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me. | I shall always remember my first visit to Boston. |
| A survey of this region was made in 1900. | This region was surveyed in 1900. |
| There were dead leaves lying on the ground. | Dead leaves covered the ground. |
| It was not long before he was very sorry. | He soon repented his words. |

The passive is acceptable when the receiver of the action is the paragraph's topic. Avoid stacking one passive on another.

### Rule 11. Put statements in positive form

Make definite assertions. Use *not* only for denial or antithesis, never for evasion.

| Negative (weak) | Positive (strong) |
|---|---|
| He was not very often on time. | He usually came late. |
| not honest | dishonest |
| did not remember | forgot |
| did not pay attention to | ignored |

The antithesis of negative and positive is strong: *Not charity, but simple justice.*

### Rule 12. Use definite, specific, concrete language

Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract.

| Vague | Concrete |
|---|---|
| A period of unfavorable weather set in. | It rained every day for a week. |
| He showed satisfaction as he took possession of his well-earned reward. | He grinned as he pocketed the coin. |

### Rule 13. Omit needless words

**The cardinal rule.** A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a machine should have no unnecessary parts. Make every word tell.

| Wordy | Concise |
|---|---|
| the question as to whether | whether |
| there is no doubt but that | no doubt |
| he is a man who | he |
| in a hasty manner | hastily |
| owing to the fact that | since |
| in spite of the fact that | though |
| the fact that he had not succeeded | his failure |
| His brother, who is a member of the same firm | His brother, a member of the same firm |

Combine scattered clauses into one: 51 words about Macbeth → 26 words.

### Rule 14. Avoid a succession of loose sentences

Do not string together clause after clause with *and*, *but*, *so*, *which*. Vary structure: use simple sentences, semicolons, periodic sentences, or three-clause constructions as the thought requires.

### Rule 15. Parallel construction for co-ordinate ideas

Expressions of similar content and function should be outwardly similar.

| Broken parallelism | Parallel |
|---|---|
| Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method, while now the laboratory method is employed. | Formerly by the textbook method; now by the laboratory method. |
| It was both a long ceremony and very tedious. | The ceremony was both long and tedious. |
| Either you must grant his request or incur his ill will. | You must either grant his request or incur his ill will. |

An article or preposition applying to all members of a series: use before the first term only, or repeat before each term.

### Rule 16. Keep related words together

Subject and verb should not be separated by a movable phrase. Relative pronouns should follow their antecedents immediately. Modifiers should sit next to the word they modify.

| Separated | Together |
|---|---|
| Wordsworth, in the fifth book of The Excursion, gives a description. | In the fifth book of The Excursion, Wordsworth gives a description. |
| He only found two mistakes. | He found only two mistakes. |

### Rule 17. In summaries, keep to one tense

Use present tense for drama summaries; present or past for prose. Do not shift between tenses. Avoid repeating *he said*, *the speaker added* — state once that what follows is summary.

### Rule 18. Place emphatic words at the end

The end of the sentence is the position of prominence; the beginning is the second strongest position.

| Weak ending | Strong ending |
|---|---|
| Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways. | Humanity has advanced in many other ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude. |
| This steel is principally used for making razors, because of its hardness. | Because of its hardness, this steel is principally used in making razors. |

This principle applies equally to sentences within a paragraph, and paragraphs within a composition.
